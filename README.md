# Using-LLM-to-Conduct-Network-Traffic-Classification

## About
This is a tool we created in the research of "Enhancing Network Traffic Classification with Large Language Models."
We use this tool to 
1. Preprocess the network traffic data.
2. Transform these data into a format suitable for the fine-tuning process.
3. Uploaded the preprocessed data to the OpenAI official dashboard to fine-tune the LLM.

We published the tool, preprocessed data, and experimental results here for reproduction.
