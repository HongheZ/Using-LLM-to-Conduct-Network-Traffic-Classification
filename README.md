# Using-LLM-to-Conduct-Network-Traffic-Classification

## About
This is a tool we create in the research of "Using LLM to Conduct Network Traffic Classification". 
We use this tool to 
1. Preprocess the network traffic data.
2. Transform these data into into a format suitable for the fine-tuning process.
3. Uploaded the preprocessed data to the OpenAI official dashboard to fine-tune the LLM.

We published the preprocessed data and experimental result here first.

**===We will open source the source code after our paper is published.===**
